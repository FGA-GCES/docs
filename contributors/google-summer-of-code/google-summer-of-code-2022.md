## Project Ideas

### Chatbot to improve agile workflow

* **Mentors:** Leonardo Ostjen, Tiago Evangelista & Gabriel Casals
* **Description:** Agile adoption is increasing year to year on the different industries.

Candidate will be working with Agile excperts and Engineers to build some solutions for this space and help pump squads productivity.
* **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with TypeScript development. Demonstrated interest and/or passion in Agile and squad productivity tools.
* **Goal/Deliverable:** Code and test chatbots to improve agile team productivity
* **Project Duration:** 350 hours.

### Bot for extracting company information

* **Mentors:** Kevin Aleman
* **Description:** Finding company information is sometimes troubled and not practical enough. You have to go to different places and links. There is an opportunity to add a “truffle sniffer” bot that helps check if an item you are looking for is on intranet/handbook for the company + learn if replies were good or bad based on emoji reactions. Participant will be working with expert engineers to build an user friendly solution to get all the “good truffles”
* **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with TypeScript development. Demonstrated interest and/or passion for AI and search engines.
* **Goal/Deliverable:** Code and test chatbots to improve agile team productivity
* **Project Duration:** 350 hours.

### Standalone Desktop Messaging cross-platforms Applet

**Mentor(s):** Jean Brito

**Description:** Create a simpler desktop application similar to the old Google Talk (see [2005 GoogleTalk UI ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\_Talk#/media/File:Google\_Talk\_Labs\_Edition\_\(screenshot\).png)here), is a simple channels list on a little window and each chat will open in another separated window, making it possible to talk with people without opening a big window. Making the usage of [Rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat) more seamless.  This project will make extensive use of Rocket.Chat's In-App Chat APIs (REST APIs).

**Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with ElectronJS and TypeScript.

**Goal/Deliverable:** Standalone app that is deployable on all platforms supported by Electron - Windows, Mac, Linux, and more.   The App will display a listing window for the channels and open each chat on another window, making the chat more popup-like.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours.

### Open Source Project Rewrite

**Mentors:** Jorge Leite

**Description:** Migrating from one technology, coding language or framework is something quite common on an industry that is constantly evolving. Having people with knowledge on performing this during early stages of their career and understanding the steps to do so is not quite as common. On this project the participant will be performing features and repos re-writes and builds while getting mentoring on clean code, unit testing, quality standards and best practices on agile software development.

**Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript development.

**Goal/Deliverable:** Proof of concept on repos and actual features migration to new standards.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours.

### **Sidebar UI revamp and UX improvements**

**Mentors:** Ivan Netto

**Description:** Converstions in [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) can be done in multiple ways but at this stage, we need a scalable interface which would help users to maximaze their daily tasks within the software. The following improviments would speed up users' workflow:

* Ability to collapse sidebar section;
* Add rooms straight from the its section header;
* Reduce the types of badge notifications, having to sizes will make the user interface more consistent and therefore, cleaner;
* Changes in the margins/paddings, which will bring a more robust visual hirarchy and scanning/reading experience;
* Changes in the colors to improve the readability.

**Desirable Skills:**&#x20;

* Experienced with HTML/CSS
* Familiarity with TypeScript development
* Attention on visual details

**Goals/Deliverables:** Improve UX of daily basis tasks on a central touch point of the software.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours.

### **Responsiveness Structure**

**Mentor(s):** Ivan Netto

**Description:** A solid approach to handle multiple screen sizes on the desktop version is a must-have. It'd benefit big range of users, from the ones using small laptops until big widescreens, maximizing the efficiency of use on each case.

**Desirable Skills:**

* Experienced with HTML/CSS
* Attention on visual details
