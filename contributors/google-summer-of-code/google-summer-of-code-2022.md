**Description:**  Rocket.Chat has long featured the ability to bridge directly witn IRC.   IRC is still in use by many hard core technical open source communities all over the world, and this bridge is very important to many of our community users.  However,  since we started evolving our architecture to be more scalable,  the IRC bridge has not been updated to match .  As a result, it has become unstable in some edge cases and also  difficult to deploy in scaled Rocket.Chat configuration.   This project aims to improve the situation.  The IRC bridge should be updated to be compatible with our scaled configuration.   Extracting from core code base and repackaging as Rocket.Chat App or npm module should be investigated.  Additional configuration/provisioning options and DevOps images will need to be created to improve the administrator's experience.

**Goals/Deliverables:**  Familiarity with Typescript development.   User of IRC and an understanding of how it works.   An understanding of how Rocket.Chat scales.

**Project Duration:** 175 hours.

### **Sidebar UI revamp and UX improvements**
