## Project Ideas

This list is being updated regularly, some projects without assigned mentors may be removed.

## Guided RC Code Walkthrough and Tutorial&#x20;

**Mentor(s):**   Kevin Aleman

**Description:** \
Most Rocket.Chat developers uses VSCode when studying our massive production code base, and when writing new code.   VSCode is the best environment for conducting interactive tutorial and code walkthroughs.  The CodeTour extension available in VSCode can be used to create such walkthrough and tutorials.  This project involves the development of a set of guided tutorials using CodeTour that will help new developers to understand how to perform multiple actions. Paths to be documented will go from this areas:

* How to create an endpoint
* How to add a new service
* How to create a DB model
* How to use DB models
* How services interact between them
* How licenses are verified
* How to build a lib
* How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, etc)

Plus any other ideas you may have.

**Desired Skills:** JNodeJS, MongoDB

**Goals/Deliverables:** A set of guided tours from the topics described above

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

### **Playground for UIKit ReactJS components**

**Mentors:** Martin Schoeler, Guilherme Gazzo

**Description:** Develop an application/playground that allows developers to test UIKit ReactJS components and Interactions. Should allow developers to generate code used by Rocket.Chat apps and edit the content to preview the result

**Desirable Skills:** JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS

**Goal/Deliverable:** An on-line web app that features a construction playground for Rocket.Chat's UIKit ReactJS components. Plus code and preview generators.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)
