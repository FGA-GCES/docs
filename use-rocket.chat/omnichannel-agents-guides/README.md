# Omnichannel Agent's Guides

As an Omnichannel agent, you can log in to your workspace using your username or email, and password. You can handle omnichannel or Livechat conversations. To be an Omnichannel agent, you must have the `Omnichannel Agent` role. Contact your administrator if you need the role.

As an omnichannel agent, your home screen has additional functions for:

* [Opening Omnichannel Queue](omnichannel-chats.md)
* [Setting Omnichannel Agent's Availability](./#undefined)
* [Opening up Omnichannel Contact Center](omnichannel-contact-center/)

## Omnichannel Agent Availability

You need to make yourself available to take up conversations. Click the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/chats-off (1).png>) icon to set your status to **Available** or the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/chats-on.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to set your status to **Unavailable**.
