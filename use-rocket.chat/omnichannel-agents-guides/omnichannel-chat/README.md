# Omnichannel Chat

When you log in to your workspace as an agent, and your status is set to **Available,** to handle new conversations:

* Any new chat initiated to the department you belong to appears on your screen with the number of messages sent by each guest under **Chats in Progress.**
* Click on a conversation to reply to a guest.
* Enter and send a message in the **Message** box or provide a file attachment if required to reply.
* Each time a guest types, it is indicated below the **Message** box with the text **guest-name is typing**.
* When a guest sends a new message, a notification briefly appears in your browser.
* Tap on a notification to go to the particular conversation.
