# Assign Message Auditing Permissions to Specific Users

The **Auditor** or **Auditor Log**  [permissions](../rocket.chat-workspace-administration/permissions.md) grant users access to **Message Auditing** features. As a workspace administrator, you assign permissions for **Message Auditing Panel** or **Auditing Log** to any [role ](../rocket.chat-workspace-administration/permissions.md#roles)you want to give audit access to.

To assign message audit permissions,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions.**
* To access the **Message Auditing Log,** check the `can-audit-log` box under the role you want to assign.
* To access the **Message Auditing Panel**, check the `can-audit` box under the role you want to assign.
