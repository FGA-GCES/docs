# Message Auditing Log

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have the `auditor-log` role or the `can-audit-log` permission to access the Message Auditing Log.
{% endhint %}

To access the message editing log, navigate to **Administration** > **Audit** > **Logs**.

If you are interested in the entire log history, clear the start and end date fields. The full log history results are presented to you, from the oldest audits to the most recent. However, if you want to see who audited messages within a specific time frame, enter the **start** (left) and end **date**s(right), and the result is automatically presented. You also have a context menu (pop-up) on the far right, which can be used to select an appropriate period.&#x20;

The message auditing logs result is presented in five columns with the following information:

* **User**: contains the name, username, and avatar of the auditors.
* **Looked for**: the search term of each audit.
* **When**: contains the date and time when each audit was made.
* **Results**: includes the number of search results returned by each audit.
* **Filters**: filters that were applied for each audit depending on the type of audit.
