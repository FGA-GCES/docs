# Agents

Omnichannel **Agents** are responsible for handling Omnichannel conversations. An agent can belong to a particular department and gets notified when a new conversation gets initiated if they are `available`.

To access this menu, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Agents**. Here, you can **view**, **add** or **remove** agents

## **1. Add Omnichannel Agent**

Select the user from the **username** drop-down field and **Add** This will automatically assign the `Omnichannel Angent` role to that user.

## **2. View Omnichannel Agent**

On the Omnichannel Agent menu, a list of all the existing agents is available with their details and can be paginated if you have many agents. An agent's status can be seen on the `Live Chat Status` tab showing whether they are `Available` or `Not Available.`

Clicking on an agent gives room for you to edit the agent's details.
