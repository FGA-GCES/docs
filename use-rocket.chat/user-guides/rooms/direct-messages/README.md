# Direct Messages

In Rocket.Chat, you can have one-on-one conversations or one-to-many conversations with users in your workspace.  For example, you want to thank someone for helping you with a confusing concept or reschedule a meeting.

They are called **Direct Messages(DMs).** Your most recent DMs are default listed under the **Direct Messages** section in your left sidebar.  They are identified by **** ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/direct-message icon.png>).



## Types Of Direct Messages

There are two types of DMs named **1:1 Direct Message** and **1:M Direct Message**.

**Direct messages (DMs)** are private one-on-one conversations between members of your workspace. You can create a direct message(DM) to another user on the same server to communicate and share files privately. It exists between just two users, and no other user can join. It can also be called **1:1 DM**.

**Direct Messages Between Multiple Users** allows you to chat with multiple users inside a DM. You can create direct message rooms between several users to exchange messages and files. Unlike [private channels](../channels/#private-channels), you do not need to specify the name, topic, or if the room is read-only. It works exactly like a 1:1 DM, the only difference is that multiple users are involved.
