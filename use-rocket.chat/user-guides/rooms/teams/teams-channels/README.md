# Manage Team Channels

Here are some essential details to know about Team Channels.

* Teams may have their own [channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels), but not all channels belong to a team.
* Teams can have both [public channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels#public-channels) and [private channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels#private-channels).
* Teams can have [Auto-join channels](teams-channel-auto-join.md) where members are automatically added to, upon joining the team.
* It is possible to add all team members to a channel
* It’s possible to add users outside the team to the team’s channels
