# Add Members to Team

You can add members to a team in two ways:&#x20;

* Send an Invite Link
* Manually Adding Users

### Send an Invite Link

At the bottom of the team members page, click **Invite Link** and copy the generated link to send to whomever you invite.

#### Edit Invite Link

Depending on how long you want an invite link to last, you can edit the invite link periodically.  \


* On the Invite Link page, Click **Edit Invite.**
* Select **Expiration (Days)** from the drop-down, select **Max number of uses, and** click **Generate New Link.**

#### Delete Invite Link

\
&#x20;To delete an invite link, see [Delete an Invite Record via Admin Panel](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/admin-panel/invites#delete-a-record). This feature comes in handy when you have an invite link with an **Expiration date: Never**. To avoid abuse, you can revoke it by deleting the invite record.

### Manually Adding Users

* At the bottom of the Team members page, click **Add.**&#x20;
* Search and select the users, then click **Add users.**&#x20;
