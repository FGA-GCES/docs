# Threads

Threads are a key part of the messaging experience in Rocket.Chat [rooms](../) and [direct messages](../direct-messages/). Theyâ€™re used to organize conversations and enable users to discuss topics without adding noise to rooms or direct messages.

Collapsed Reply Threads offer an improved experience for users communicating in threads and replying to messages that include a unified threads inbox to read all conversations in one view. Threads improve the ability to process room content, find, follow, and resume conversations more easily, and keep threaded conversations focused.

Threads are identified following the symbol
