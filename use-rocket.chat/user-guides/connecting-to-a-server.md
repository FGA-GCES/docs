## Registering an account

To access any Rocket.Chat server, register an account manually, or use one of the many supported OAuth services (if the desired server has enabled these services). After successfully registering, you can log in to the server.

### Manual Registration

You can create an account by providing your:

* Name
* Email
* Password
* Reason to join

A server can ask you to verify your email; you can do this by simply clicking on the link sent to the registered email.

Servers can be configured to use custom parameters. Therefore each Rocket.Chat servers might ask for different information or restrict registration based on the rules set by the server. You can contact your server administrator if you are unsure how to register your account,&#x20;

### OAuth Registration

If your server has configured OAuth services (i.e., GitHub or Google), use the account credentials for that supported service to register into the server.

### Choosing a username and display name

After you have successfully registered your account, you can choose your username. Your username is your unique identifier for others to use to direct message or mention you.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Your username is separate from your display name on the server.
{% endhint %}

Usernames on each Rocket.Chat server must be unique to that server. However, display names can repeat on the same server. For example, there can be only one user with the username:`johnsmith`, but there can be more than one user with the display name :`John Smith`.
