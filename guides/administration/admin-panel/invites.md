# Invites

Under **Invites**, you can view all the invite links generated to invite users to the workspace/channels.

## Delete a record

If you want to delete any of these invite records:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (410) (1).png>)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (405) (1) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature comes in handy when you have an invite link with an **Expiration** **date: Never**. In order to avoid abuse, you can revoke it by deleting the record.
{% endhint %}
