* **Homeserver Token** _(_`Federation_Matrix_hs_token`, _automatically generated by Rocket.Chat)_**:** A unique homeserver token to authenticate requests to application services. Example: _http://localhost:8008_

* **Bridge URL**(`Federation_Matrix_bridge_url)`**:** The URL for the Matrix bridge. IT is the location you want your bridge should run.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Make sure the port that you are using for the bridge is free in your host, otherwise the Rocket.Chat server will crash trying to run a bridge.
* We recommend a new, empty homeserver, to be used with the federation.
* No user should connect to the homeserver with third-party clients, only Rocket.Chat.
{% endhint %}
