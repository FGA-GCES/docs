# Marketplace Roles

With the most recent release of Marketplace, we have introduced roles. Internally, we have two different roles; one within the publisher and the second within the system. Henceforth known as publisher roles and system roles.

## Publisher Roles

There are three different roles within a Publisher.

* Owner
* Developer
* Viewer

The Owner role is applied whenever someone creates a publisher. Each of the subsequent roles only applies to people they have invited.

### Publisher: Owner

The owner can do everything.

### Publisher: Developer

The developer can read everything. However, the developer role can also update Apps \(can not create them, that requires an Owner\).

### Publisher: Viewer

The viewer role can read everything and can not update anything.

## System Roles

There are five different roles within the System.  


* User
* Viewer
* Support
* Reviewer
* Admin

### System: User

The system role of the User is the role that most people in the Marketplace system have. This role can not view any of the administration.

### System: Viewer

The system role of Viewer can view everything in the Marketplace Administration. They cannot, however, make any updates, create, or remove anything.

### System: Support

The system role of Support can read a limited subsection of the Marketplace Administration area. These include the Apps, Bundles, Addons, Publishers, Compile Jobs, Purchase Records, and Workspaces. The only two areas the Support role can update are the Purchase Records and the Workspaces.

### System: Reviewer

The system role of the Reviewer can read everything inside the Marketplace Administration area. The Reviewer can only update the Apps area to approve, reject, and perform any other action required on Apps.

### System: Admin

The system role of Admin can do everything inside of the Marketplace Administration area.
