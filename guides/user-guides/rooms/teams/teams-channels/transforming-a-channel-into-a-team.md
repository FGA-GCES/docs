# Transforming a Channel into a team

A channel owner can transform an existing channel into a team anytime. The channel must belong to the workspace rather than already in a team. Otherwise, the option to transform into a team is not available.

A private channel converts to a private team, and a public channel converts to a public team.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This decision can't be reversed! Therefore, please exercise extreme caution while converting a channel into a team.
{% endhint %}

* To transform a channel into a team, click the **Room Information** icon at the top-right side of the channel home page.
* Click the **three dots** icon next to **Delete**, then select **Convert to Team**.
