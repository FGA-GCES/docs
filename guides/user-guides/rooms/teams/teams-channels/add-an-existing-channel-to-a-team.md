# Add an existing channel to a team

To add an existing channel to a team, you must be the channel owner and have specific permissions in the team to add an existing channel.

When adding a channel to a team, the team owner gains rights over the channel (e.g., It's possible for the team owner to delete that channel).



* Click the **Team Channels** icon at the top-right side of the team home page.&#x20;
* Click **Add Existing** at the bottom of the Team Channels page.
* Search and select the channels you'll like to add to the team.
* Click **Add**.
