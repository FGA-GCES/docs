# Team Auto-Join Channels

Teams can have Auto-join channels—channels where team members are added automatically. It reduces extra work with handling users and the channels they must belong to. It’s also handy for onboarding teams with many different channels.&#x20;

For instance, you can use Auto-join to quickly include new members joining the company to specific onboarding channels. You could set Auto-join to automatically include team members in company-related channels, such as channels meant to share updates and company news. You can mark a channel **Auto-join** for members to join them automatically once they join a team.

Mark a channel as **Auto-join** by following the steps below.

* Click the Team Channels icon to view the list of channels in the team.
* Select the **three dots** icon beside the channel name.
* Mark the **Auto-join** checkbox.
