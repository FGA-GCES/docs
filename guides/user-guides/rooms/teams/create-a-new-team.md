# Create a new Team

When creating a team, you can define its [privacy and encryption levels](create-a-new-team.md#team-privacy-and-encryption).

### Team Privacy and Encryption

#### Read-Only Teams

Only authorized users (users with write permissions) can send messages in read-only teams. All other users can react to messages on this channel.

#### Broadcast Teams

Like read-only teams, broadcast teams allow only authorized users with the appropriate permissions to write new messages, while other users can reply to existing messages.

However, it differs from read-only teams in a few ways:

* All messages have a reply button that redirects you to the sender's direct message (DM), replying to the message as a quote.
* The team cannot be converted to a read-only again.

#### Encrypted Teams

Encrypted teams have end-to-end encryption enabled across all messages exchanged by the Team members.
