# Teams

A  team can have multiple [channels](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels). In Rocket.Chat, Team is a digital workspace that allows you to manage multiple users simultaneously, making it easier for you to collaborate with teammates.

Teams is available to both community and enterprise clients. They are identified by ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/team (2).png>).&#x20;

\
Teams can be made private so that only invited members are allowed to join or public so that all Rocket.Chat users can see them. Each Team may consist of channels, which may also be either [public ](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels/types-of-channels#public-channels)or [private](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/user-guides/rooms/channels/types-of-channels#private-channels).&#x20;
