Monitors in Omnichannel are users that have the ability to monitor Omnichannel activities and have access to [Current Chats](current-chats.md), [Analytics](analytics.md), Real-time Monitoring, Agents, Departments, Business Hours and Canned Responses.

To access this setting, go to **Avatar Menu  > Omnichannel > Monitors**.

## 1. List Omnichannel Monitors

On the Monitors page, a list of all the users with `livechat-monitor` role is displayed. From here, you can add new monitors or delete existing monitors.

## 2. Add New Omnichannel Monitor

To add a new monitor(s), enter the person's username in the username field and hit the **Add** button. This will automatically assign that user the `livechat-monitor` role.

## 3. Delete Omnichannel Monitor

To delete an Omnichannel Monitor, click the **Delete icon** on the right across the user. This will remove the `livechat-monitor` role from that user.
