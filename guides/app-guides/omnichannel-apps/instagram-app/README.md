# Instagram App

With the Instagram app, you can handle messages from your Instagram contacts directly in Rocket.Chat. It works simply: your Instagram customers contact you via Instagram, you answer chats from Rocket.Chat. Some key features of this integration include sending messages with quick reply buttons, welcome messages(starting/closing chat), file sharing, and the correlation between your Instagram pages and your Rocket.Chat departments.
