At this step, you must have a Instagram page associated with the account. If you donâ€™t have one yet, you can [create yours in just 30 seconds](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/?ref\_type=registration\_form).

In case you have multiple pages associated with your Instagram account it will prompt a selection box to choose the preferred page to connect.

After successfully selecting your page, you will receive a success message with credentials, as shown below:

Try it out by sending a message to your Instagram page.

After successful authentication, as an admin, you are subscribed to the Instagram page by default. But you can choose to unsubscribe if you want, as shown below:
