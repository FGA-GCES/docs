# Voice Channel Technical Specification

VoIP is the technology behind Rocket.Chat voice-as-channel feature.

### **What is VoIP?**

**Voice over Internet Protocol** refers to the standards that facilitate voice-based phone calls using an internet connection instead of a local telephone company. \
Through VoIP technologies, Rocket.Chat is able to incorporate telephony-based communication protocols into its applications, promoting the transition between analog and digital technologies.

### How does VoIP work?

Voice over IP converts your voice into a digital signal, compresses it, and sends it over the internet. A VoIP service provider sets up the call between all participants. The digital data is then uncompressed into the sound that you hear through your handset on the receiving end.

### Why is VoIP Important for the Omnichannel environment?

In a contact center environment, Voice is an important and influential channel. Agents using OmniChannel stack should be able to make audio/video calls to external PSTN networks, cellphone networks, and VoIP endpoints supporting SIP protocol.

Once Rocket.Chat voice-as-channel or VoIP is in place; our Enterprise Edition provides many call center features.
