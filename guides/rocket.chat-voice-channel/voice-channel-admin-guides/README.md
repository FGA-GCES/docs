# Voice Channel Admin Guides

As a Rocket.Chat administrator, you can configure and manage Rocket.Chat call center operations.

**You can configure:**

* Management server address and credentials.
* Configuration of call server address and credentials (if any)
* Association of agents with extensions

Please make sure your environment meets the prerequisites to be able to configure VoIP/Call Center feature on your Rocket.Chat instance.

When it comes configuring call center capabilities on your Rocket.Chat instance there are two paths. You can choose one according to your situation.&#x20;

1. [Configure without previously having a PBX server](../getting-started-with-voice-channel/configure-without-previously-having-a-pbx-server/)
2. [Configure with an active PBX server](<../getting-started-with-voice-channel/configure with an active PBX server.md>)
