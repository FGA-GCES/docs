# Rocket.Chat Marketplace

[Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) Apps are extensions, or plugins, that can be added to your workspace to customize your collaboration experience. For example, you can install Reminders and insert the Add Reminder button on a message in your workspace. Rocket.Chat provides many apps that can be installed and managed through the marketplace. You can search for any app on the marketplace and install it on your Rocket.Chat server. You can also upload your custom app package yourself and then install it.

**These Apps can do the following :**

* Display interactive and dynamic content on their own surface - like a modal or the roomâ€™s contextual bar.
* Create buttons in the UI for users to interact with native content.
* Create slash commands for users to trigger more generic interactions.
* Register endpoints to receive data from other applications and services.
* Work on both desktop and mobile clients.
* Send messages to users; create and manage public channels, groups, discussions, and threads.
