# Rocket.Chat Marketplace

[Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) Apps are extensions, or plugins, that can be added to your workspace to tailor your collaboration experience to your needs.

Rocket.Chat provides you with a lot of apps. They can be installed and managed through the marketplace. You can search for any app on the marketplace and can install it on your own Rocket.Chat server. You can also upload your custom app package yourself and then install it.

**Apps can:**

* Display interactive and dynamic content on their own surface - like a modal or the room’s contextual bar.
* Create buttons in the UI for users to interact with native content.
* Create slash commands for users to trigger more generic interactions.
* Register endpoints to receive data from other applications and services.
* Work on both desktop and mobile clients.
* Send messages to users; create and manage public channels, groups, discussions, and threads.

**Here are some examples:**

* Insert image of Poll’s slash command
* Insert image of Poll’s modal
* Insert image of Add Reminder’s action button on a message

In order to install Rocket.Chat apps from the marketplace, you first need to register your workplace (even if it is a community edition ) on [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat). Use the login button at the top right to log in to Rocket.Chat Cloud.
