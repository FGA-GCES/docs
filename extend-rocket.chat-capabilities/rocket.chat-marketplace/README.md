# Rocket.Chat Marketplace

[Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) Apps are extensions, or plugins, that can be added to your workspace to tailor your collaboration experience to your needs.

Apps can:

* Display interactive and dynamic content on their own surface - like a modal or the room’s contextual bar.
* Create buttons in the UI for users to interact with native content.
* Create slash commands for users to trigger more generic interactions.
* Register endpoints to receive data from other applications and services.
* Work on both desktop and mobile clients.
* Send messages to users; create and manage public channels, groups, discussions, and threads.

Here are some examples:

_Insert image of Poll’s slash command_

_Insert image of Poll’s modal_

_Insert image of Add Reminder’s action button on a message_
