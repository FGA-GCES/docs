# Rocket.Chat Marketplace

[Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) Apps are extensions, or plugins, that can be added to your workspace to customize your collaboration experience. For example, you can install Reminders and insert the Add Reminder button on a message in your workspace. Rocket.Chat provides many apps that can be installed and managed through the marketplace. You can search for any app on the marketplace and install it on your Rocket.Chat server. You can also upload your custom app package yourself and then install it.

**These Apps can do the following :**

* Display interactive and dynamic content on their own surface - like a modal or the roomâ€™s contextual bar.
* Create buttons in the UI for users to interact with native content.
* Create slash commands for users to trigger more generic interactions.
* Register endpoints to receive data from other applications and services.
* Work on both desktop and mobile clients.
* Send messages to users; create and manage public channels, groups, discussions, and threads.

You must register your workspace (even if it is a community edition) on [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat) before you can install apps from the Rocket.Chat marketplace. Use the login button at the top right to log in to Rocket.Chat Cloud.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can browse Rocket.Chat apps either on our [marketplace](https://rocket.chat/marketplace) or access them directly from **Administration > Workspace > Apps.**

On the **Marketplace** tab of the **Apps** screen,

* You can see all the apps available on Rocket.Chat and seach for the one you need.
* You can also filter based on **Categories, Status, and Price.** Choose between multiple categories within the filter to help you find the best app for your workspace users.
* <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tag next to an app on the marketplace means you need to upgrade your workspace to a higher version in order to use the app.

On the **Installed** tab of the **Apps** screen,

* You can find the apps you have installed on your workspace.
* **Enable/Disable/Uninstall** any of your installed apps.
* View App details.
* View **logs** of the app.
* Provide additional user settings and configuration for the app. (All Rocket.Chat Apps might not require any setup configuration or user settings.)
